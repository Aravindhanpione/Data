Those who know the procedure of puja will do it at home every day in the morning and some people do it in the evening too. The duration of a basic puja is anywhere between 5 minutes to 3 hours. It all depends upon the type of puja one performs. In the temples regular puja is done in the morning and also in the evening.  In addition to regular puja many special puja’s take place in the temples during the day and evening.

                                        <p>Mainly the puja is of two types - A Simple Puja and Detailed Puja. The beauty is that God would be pleased by the quality of the puja and not by the time frame of the puja.  So, a devotee can receive the grace of God by performing either of these Puja’s according to his/her capacity.</p>
                                        <b>A Simple Puja</b>
                                        <p>A simple puja is a very basic one in which a devotee says some prayers glorifying God’s attributes and thanking him for everything that he/she has been given in this life. These prayers are the in the form of chants and verses from the Holy Scriptures like the Vedas, bhagavat gita, Ramayana, Bhagavatham, etc. Depending on the length of the prayer, this puja will take only 5 to 15 minutes. Every faithful Hindu performs this prayer every day in the morning after the shower and before eating food. When performing this puja usually a devotee stands or sits in front of God’s idol or picture.</p>
                                        <b>A Detailed Puja</b>
                                        <p>In a detailed puja a devotee worships God in several steps and all these steps demonstrate his/her love and devotion to God. The duration for this puja is anywhere between 30 min to 3 hours. A detailed puja contains 16 services offered to God with love and devotion. These steps are similar to how we honor and treat our beloved guests during their visit to our place.</p>

                                        <p>Homam is a very powerful tool for spiritual progress. Chanting mantras in front of fire while offering material substances into fire has a great cleansing and calming influence on one's mind and gives great level of mental focus, peace, calmness and bliss. This practice has been extolled in many scriptures such as Yajurveda and Bhagavad Gita. Vedic seers practiced it regularly. Several people are experiencing the benefits of homam even today. The proof of the pudding is in one's mental state.</p>
                                        <p>Success, happiness, achievements, fame, wealth and pleasures that you seek or enjoy in your life are the result of your deeds or actions.  However, the nature of life is such that though you may have complete control over your actions, you cannot have control over the results. Various outer forces and factors influence and determine the results of your actions. This is a day-to-day fact in the life of each and every one of us.The ancient seers have understood this so well that they have prescribed various tools, techniques and remedies to help you fulfill your different needs, goals and aspirations. Homam (fire Rituals) is one such powerful technology to ensure that the results of your actions are fruitful and all your dreams are realized.</p>
